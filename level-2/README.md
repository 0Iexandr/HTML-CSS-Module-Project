## Level 2
The aim of this exercise is to add a new section to the homepage, and create a new page with an Order form.

### Set up

You can choose to add your code for Level 2 to the same branch you were using for Level 1, or to create a new 'level-2' branch. 

# Instructions

- You'll find the designs inside the 'level 2' folder.
- Add the new design block in your `index.html`
- Create a new page called `order.html` and re-create the design for the Order form page (find this in the Level 2 folder as well)
- For the Order page styles, you can keep using the same `style.css` file and add your Order page styles in there. Make sure the stylesheet is imported in the `<head>` of `order.html`.
You could also create a specific `order.css` file - just make sure you're not duplicating the CSS already defined in `style.css`! 
- Connect the 2 pages by making the homepage's "Get Karma today" button navigate to the Order page.

### Submitting your work
 - Remember to **commit and push your code often**
 - Once you're ready to submit your homework for review, do a final push and **create a Pull Request**. If you're unsure how to do this, [have a look here](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/git/cheatsheet/#i-want-to-send-my-code-to-volunteers-pushing).
 **Note:** If you've added your level 2 code to the same branch as level 1, then it will just update your level 1 Pull Request and you won't need a new PR.
